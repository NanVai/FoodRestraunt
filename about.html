        <h2 >The NJ Pizzas</h2>
        <div ></div>
        <p> NJ’s  make fresh dough daily — often twice daily — from scratch. Produce is delivered 6 days a week to ensure only the freshest ingredients possible. NJ’s only uses one hundred percent whole milk mozzarella grated daily on site and nothing but fresh toppings, as Al knows there is no substitute for quality. While quality, handmade pizza created in the classic New York tradition is the cornerstone of NJ’s Pizza, the ambiance of the restaurant adds to its appeal.</p>
        <p>Casual and stylish, the restaurants are a warm take on a contemporary vibe. Sleekly designed with cool fixtures and unexpectedly elegant twists, Al’s is a place you can go for a glass of wine with friends or take the entire little league team out for a Sicilian pizza. Come watch our skilled artisans as they hand stretch and toss dough while turning pies in a traditional brick oven.
